When I've built up my savings, I'll be able to travel to Mexico.
Wouldn't it be lovely to enjoy a week soaking up the culture?
The plots failed because of some trusted friends of the king.
After the death of the king, everyone wanted to be a king.
War does not bring anything good to the common people.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Caught between a rock and a hard place.
Closing the barn door after the horse escapes.

Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
Friends are flowers in the garden of life.
The grass is always greener on the other side.

The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees.

A weed is no more than a flower in disguise.

You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
All work and no play robs one of some fun in life.
Your car is out of date as soon as it is paid for.
